        Shirley Chisholm was born in New York in 1924 and, later, raised by her grandmother in Barbados. During the 60s, <br>
        she became the first female black member of the New York state assembly and House of Representatives. Chisholm also <br>
        sponsored the introduction of a program known as SEEK (Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge), which helped <br>
        disadvantaged students to go to college. She went on to lead many movements for the Council of Elected Negro Democrats.
